# `fab` 🔊 - A toolkit for audio analysis

Welcome to `fab`! 👋 <br />
This is a Python package made to help you easily analyze voice and speech in audio recordings. With `fab`, you get simple tools that you can mix and match to do your experiments faster, whether you're doing research or just exploring.

### Motivation
To provide a straightforward solution for setting up an environment dedicated to speech analysis.
To offer functional blocks that simplify the processing and analysis of speech and voice data.
To support the reproducibility of speech and voice data analysis efforts.

<strong> Please, be careful 🚨: </strong> `fab` is still being worked on, so you might find some bugs. 🐛 

## About the name 😂
`fab` started as <ins>F</ins>abio's <ins>A</ins>udio <ins>B</ins>ox, named after its creator, [Fabio Catania](https://gablab.mit.edu/team/catania-fabio/). Over time, it has grown into a <ins>F</ins>unctional <ins>A</ins>udio <ins>B</ins>ase, offering <ins>F</ins>undamental <ins>A</ins>udio <ins>B</ins>locks and adopting a <ins>F</ins>riendly <ins>A</ins>udio <ins>B</ins>uddy vibe. And let's be honest, it's always been and will continue to be absolutely a <ins>FAB</ins>ulous python package!
